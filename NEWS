API Changes:

2008.12.11 map-nodes argument order change

* map-nodes and map-nodes->list now take fn as the first argument,
  rather than the second, to match the way map, mapcar,
  etc... work. This is an incompatible API change and all calls to
  map-nodes or map-nodes->list will need to be updated to reflect this
  change to the API.
