API Changes:

2012.05.09 map-edges argument change -- INCOMPATIBILE API CHANGE

* map-edges now takes a result-type argument (a la map). This is an
  incompatible API change and all calls to map-edges will need to be
  updated to reflect this change to the API.

2008.12.11 map-nodes argument order change

* map-nodes and map-nodes->list now take fn as the first argument,
  rather than the second, to match the way map, mapcar,
  etc... work. This is an incompatible API change and all calls to
  map-nodes or map-nodes->list will need to be updated to reflect this
  change to the API.
